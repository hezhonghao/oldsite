<h1>Zhonghao He</h1>
<p>Hi! I am Zhonghao,a master student at University of Cambridge.
    I've been working on topics including agentic risks, alignment, interpretabilty and neuroscience (upcoming). 

    Utimately, I want to build AIs for human excellences (in Greek conception), which requires both sound sociatal mechanism design and epistemic tools with which individuals can better exercise their agency. 
    A lot of efforts required to operationalize those concepts, but broadly these topics are relevant: mechanistic interpretability, computational neuroscience, AI ethics, alignment, political philosophy, virtue ethics, multi-agent systems, and human-computer interface.
